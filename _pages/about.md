<br><br>
🤓 I'm a first year undergraduate student studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Northwestern University <br><br>
🌎 I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio but was born and raised in Upstate New York. Currently located in Evanston, IL <br><br>
🖥️ My main tech interests are in Quantitative Development, and I am particularly interested in Algorithms and Optimizations. <br><br>
🎲 Outside of academic and work-related realms, you can find me playing poker (very badly) with friends, playing soccer, going bowling or topgolfing (not sure if thats a verb), and spending time with my Golden Retriever, Laken. <br><br>
