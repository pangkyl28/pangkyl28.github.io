In my Junior year of High School, I was asked whether it was possible to automate folder creation in Google Drive. This project was meant to help my High School's yearbook club as my school was small and wanted every student to be included in the yearbook so folders needed to be assigned to each student to store their photos. <br><br>
What this does is creates a folder for every student name that is listed in an excel sheet. Depending on what cell you write in, you could also be building a folder within a folder as well. <br><br>
Additionally, as time went on, teachers came to me to expand the scope of this project so that they could use it in the classroom so now in addition to creating a folder for each student, it also creates files within the folder assigned to each student. Ex. An elementary math teacher wanted to give each student practice problems in a google doc that they could work in so the Autofolder creator generated folders for each student and within the folder it contained the math practice document. <br><br>
